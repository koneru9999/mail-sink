# mail-sink

MailSink runs a super simple SMTP server which traps any message sent to it to display in a web interface. Run mailsinker, set your favourite app to deliver to smtp://127.0.0.1:1025 instead of your default SMTP server, then check out http://127.0.0.1:8080 to see the mail that's arrived so far.
